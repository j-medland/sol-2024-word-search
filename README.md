# Summer of LabVIEW 2024 Word Search - Bonus Maximum C++ Version

> **WARNING**
> This version handles all the LabVIEW types and memory allocation from the C++ side to demonstrate what is possible
> 
> It hasn't been tested on Linux so the CMake script will complain if you try and build with a non MSVC compiler

> **Note**
> Given a 2D array of letters and a list of words to find, return a map of words with the positions of each letter. 
> Try to code as efficient an algorithm as you can as submissions will be ranked by how fast they complete the word search correctly.
> Challenge ends at 11:59 UTC on June 22 and submissions beyond that time will not be scored.

## Dependencies
LabVIEW 2020 Community Edition or later

## Building the Binaries
If you plan on building the C++ code into binaries you will need a compiler that supports the C++ 20 standard (specifically `std::span`) such as
* MSVC on Windows (2019 onwards)
* GCC on Linux (10 onwards)
* CMake 3.5 or later

A copy of the binaries is included in this repository so you can just `clone` and go but if want to make changes to the C++ code, binary builds are managed via CMake - check for CMake integration in your IDE for ease of use.

An example `.vscode` configuration for building and connecting the C++ debugger is provided for both platforms for _VS Code_ users. 

Use CMake to `configure`, `build` and `install` the *Release* version for maximum performance

## Licence
